**N7 Game** is a 2D pixel art story-driven horror game created by a team of 6 students during our first year at university. The project is a blend of storytelling, suspense, and psychological horror, wrapped in nostalgic pixel-style visuals.

## 🎮 Game Concept

In this game, players take on the role of **Lucia**, a university student who forgets something important in a lecture building. She returns late at night to retrieve it — but what begins as a simple task soon spirals into something far more sinister.

A mysterious and charming upperclassman, who is widely admired across campus, hides a disturbing secret. What appears to be harmless infatuation quickly turns into a night of psychological horror.
